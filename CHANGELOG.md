All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased][]

### Fixed

- Fixing bundle size command on CircleCI pipeline

## [10.0.0][] - 2020-07-18

### Updated

- Breaking changes: updating `feature-toggle-service` to version 6.0.0. The new package behavior introduces combination instead of overriding. Since it's a different feature, it can affect nested provider components.

## [9.0.0][] - 2020-07-18

### Updated

- Breaking changes: updating `feature-toggle-service` to version 6.0.0. The new package behavior introduces combination instead of overriding. Since it's a different feature, it can affect nested provider components.

## [8.0.0][] - 2020-06-13

### Added

- Adding support for accept array or string as feature toggle configuration of

  - `NgxFeatureToggleCanLoadGuard`
  - `NgxFeatureToggleCanActivateGuard`
  - `NgxFeatureToggleCanActivateChildGuard`

- `*featureToggle` now supports a string or an array of toggles to be checked

```html
<div
  class="feature-toggle-enabled-with-exclamation-mark"
  *featureToggle="'enableFirstText'"
>
  Feature toggle is enabled if `enableFirstText` is true
</div>

<div
  class="feature-toggle-enabled-with-exclamation-mark"
  *featureToggle="['enableFirstText', 'enableSecondText']"
>
  Feature toggle is enabled if both feature toggles are true
</div>
```

### Updated

- Breaking changes:
  - `*featureToggleWhenDisabled` directive was removed since we can have the same behavior by using `*featureToggle` directive and passing `!` as a prefix for the feature toggle.

```html
<div
  class="feature-toggle-enabled-with-exclamation-mark"
  *featureToggle="'enableFirstText'"
>
  Feature toggle is enabled
</div>
<div
  class="feature-toggle-enabled-with-exclamation-mark"
  *featureToggle="'!enableFirstText'"
>
  Feature toggle disabled since it's enabled and it has <b>!</b> at front.
</div>
```

## [7.0.1][] - 2019-06-09

### Updated

- Updating Angular CLI to v8

## [7.0.0][] - 2019-04-09

### Fixed

- Fixed component to trigger Angular Lifecycle of components inside

If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration
path for existing applications: â€¦

It removed `<feature-toggle>` component. Instead of it it will add 2 new directives:

- `*featureToggle`: Directive that handles with feature toggle check. So that, the component will be rendered/removed based on the feature toggle configuration is enabled;
- `*featureToggleWhenDisabled`: Directive that handles with feature toggle check. So that, the component will be rendered/removed when the feature toggle configuration is disabled;

So that, the new flow will be:

```html
<feature-toggle-provider [features]="featureToggleData">
  <div *featureToggle="'enableSecondText'">
    <p>condition is true and "featureToggle" is enabled.</p>
  </div>
  <div *featureToggleWhenDisabled="'enableFirstText'">
    <p>
      condition is false and "featureToggle" is disabled
      <b>and it has "featureToggleWhenDisabled" directive.</b> In that case this
      content should be rendered.
    </p>
  </div>
</feature-toggle-provider>
```

- Avoiding add multiple components in first-page load. The components with enabled features were added thrice.
