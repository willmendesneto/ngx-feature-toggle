## [7.0.1][] - 2019-06-09

### Updated

- Updating Angular CLI to v8

## [7.0.0][] - 2019-04-09

### Fixed

- Fixed component to trigger Angular Lifecycle of components inside

If this PR contains a breaking change, please describe the impact and migration
path for existing applications: â€¦

It removed `<feature-toggle>` component. Instead of it it will add 2 new directives:

- `*featureToggle`: Directive that handles with feature toggle check. So that, the component will be rendered/removed based on the feature toggle configuration is enabled;
- `*featureToggleWhenDisabled`: Directive that handles with feature toggle check. So that, the component will be rendered/removed when the feature toggle configuration is disabled;

So that, the new flow will be:

```html
<feature-toggle-provider [features]="featureToggleData">
  <div *featureToggle="'enableSecondText'">
    <p>condition is true and "featureToggle" is enabled.</p>
  </div>
  <div *featureToggleWhenDisabled="'enableFirstText'">
    <p>
      condition is false and "featureToggle" is disabled
      <b>and it has "featureToggleWhenDisabled" directive.</b> In that case this content should be
      rendered.
    </p>
  </div>
</feature-toggle-provider>
```

- Avoiding add multiple components in first-page load. The components with enabled features were added thrice.
